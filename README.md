# CSR - Common Script Runtime 

CSR is a runtime for JASM bytecode assembly. The purpose of CSR is to give life to JASM bytecode and make it 
useful. After all, a bytecode that can't be run doesn't really mean anything. In addition, the future plans 
for this project includes adding JIT compilation support for JASM bytecode.

CSR is a part of CSLB project. The CSLB project (which stands for Common Scripting Language Backend, pronunced as SeezleBee)
consists of three parts: Assembler, Linker and Runtime. The runtime part is CSR itself, as can be understood from the name.
The assembler and linker make up JASM and it has its own repo.
